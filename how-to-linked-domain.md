# How to Link a Domain: Exabytes to Shopify

This guide explains how I implemented the domain `dafanyascarf.id` from Exabytes to Shopify. I chose Exabytes because the pricing for domain registration and hosting is affordable, and it's easy to transfer the domain to various websites based on the company's needs. I purchased both the hosting and domain package at Exabytes.

## Steps to Link the Domain:

### 1. Login to Exabytes and Access cPanel
- First, log in to your Exabytes account and select **Layanan** > click on **cPanel Hosting**, or you can also log directly into **cPanel** by entering your email and password.

### 4. Redirect Domain to the Desired Website
- You will be directed to the **Tools** page to transfer the domain's code to the website you want to use. Since I am using Shopify, once inside Shopify, you'll find a feature to set up the domain. This section contains the code that needs to be entered in cPanel according to the "filter name."
